Etch-a-sketch is a simple canvas, which has by default 16x16 blocks (can be resized by pressing the "New sketch" button).
On this canvas, using the mouse, a user is drawing random colors on the canvas.
Also, by pressing left-click, a user can darken hovered pixel.



This is only a DOM-manipulation code-practice project from The Odin Project's "Foundations" course.
